# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

This repository restructures the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial into a fully reproducible research package.  
It contains the necessary data, utilities, and environment specifications to replicate the analysis that detected gravitational waves from the event GW150914.

### Overview
- Converts the original LIGO tutorial into a reproducible Python package called `ligotools`.  
- Defines an isolated Conda environment (`ligo`) for dependency management.  
- Enables one-click execution via Binder for open, reproducible workflows.  
- Demonstrates best practices in version control, modular code design, and environment reproducibility.
